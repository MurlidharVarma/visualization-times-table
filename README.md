# visualization-times-table
This one has been one of my favourite weekend project I did. 

Visualize and play around with Times-Table.

I got inspiration to build this project when I watched this awesome [Mathologer Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/qhbuKbxJsk8) on Times-Table concept.
This project is build entirely using P5js. It's such a great library!

Hope you like it!

Watch demo video.
